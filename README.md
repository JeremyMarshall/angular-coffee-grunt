angular-coffee-grunt
====================

This is a coffee reimplementation of http://yeoman.io/codelab.html#toc

So I guess its yeoman-angular-coffee-grunt really

mainly to build with coffee instead of javascript do this

```
yo angular --coffee
```

And then carry on and do the tutorial

http://js2coffee.org is a good place to translate javascript into coffee (so it can convert it back again)

Incidentally, the web.js and Procfile are there so you can push it out to Heroku. This assumes the dist directory is built
