angular-coffee-grunt
====================

This is a coffee reimplementation of http://yeoman.io/codelab.html#toc

So I guess its yeoman-angular-coffee-grunt really

mainly to build with coffee instead of javascript do this

```
yo angular --coffee
```

And then carry on and do the tutorial

http://js2coffee.org is a good place to translate javascript into coffee (so it can convert it back again)
